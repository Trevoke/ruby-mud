# ruby-mud
A Ruby MUD server. Current project status: toy

Thoughts:

- Spawn a new process for a room
- Find a reasonable way to store information for rooms. 
  - One YAML file per room? How to name them? How to link them? How to uniquely identify them?
  - Maybe a MUD editor could abstract this away?
